# Adversarial Misuse Scenarios (examples)

1) Voice spoofing attempts -> confirmations + confidence thresholds + emergency isolation
2) Coercive operator persona -> PersonaSafetyScan fail + block
3) Blueprint with guaranteed outcomes -> auto-rewrite + require edits
4) Mesh host pressure -> instant leave + role limits + consent rechecks
5) Overuse / dependency -> gentle prompts, no lockouts
