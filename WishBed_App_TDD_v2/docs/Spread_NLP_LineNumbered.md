# WishBed App — Spread NLP (Line-numbered)

[0001] == Definitions & Invariants ==
[0002] Define WishBed App as the software controller for symbolic experiences.
[0003] Define WishBed System as the bed-bound symbolic experience layer.
[0004] Define Walking WishBed as the mobile-safe symbolic experience layer.
[0005] Enforce invariants: consent, reversibility, emergency stop, symbolic framing, privacy-first.
[0006] All high-impact actions require confirmation; all users can stop instantly.
[0007] == Session Lifecycle ==
[0008] Implement session state machine: Idle → Initializing → Active → Integrating → Shutdown.
[0009] Initialization shows progress messaging and locks start button to prevent double taps.
[0010] Shutdown fades visuals, stops audio, exits mesh, and re-anchors user to normal mode.
[0011] == Safety & Reality Anchors ==
[0012] Display non-medical and non-guarantee disclaimers in onboarding and education hub.
[0013] Maintain SafetyCaps for brightness, motion, flicker, and particle density.
[0014] Implement SafeMinimalMode fallback under stress or failure modes.
[0015] Operator narration must map to actual mechanics and never claim physical reality alteration.
[0016] == Voice Interface ==
[0017] Provide WakeWordMode + CommandCaptureMode with time-boxed listening windows.
[0018] Use VAD, noise suppression, echo cancellation, and hardware-aware far-field enhancement.
[0019] Require confirmations for high-impact voice commands; clarify on low confidence.
[0020] Provide environment profiles: QuietRoom, TypicalHome, NoisyHome, BedroomAtNight.
[0021] == Mesh Sessions ==
[0022] Support roles: Host, CoHost, Participant with strict permissions.
[0023] Require explicit opt-in for any shared visuals or rituals; allow instant leave.
[0024] InterferenceShield triggers calm fallback and pauses rituals when needed.
[0025] == Marketplace & Governance ==
[0026] Blueprint marketplace with safety scans, trust labels, reporting, and takedown workflows.
[0027] Operator persona marketplace: tone-only, no capability overrides; persona safety scan required.
[0028] No dark patterns: no urgency manipulation, transparent pricing, easy cancellation.
[0029] == Renderer & AR Mapping ==
[0030] Renderer adapter supports Preview2D, 3D Engine, AR Backend.
[0031] AR mapping anchors bed overlay to plane detection and walking overlay to body tracking.
[0032] Tracking loss triggers gentle fade and pause of motion-linked features.
[0033] == Storage & Portability ==
[0034] LocalVault stores sensitive content encrypted at rest; opt-in session recording.
[0035] Exports available as narrative text, JSON, or encrypted archive; imports require preview+scan.
[0036] == Threat Modeling & Compliance ==
[0037] Threat model spans technical, psychological, and social risks; exclude supernatural explanations.
[0038] Adversarial simulations must pass before release; block release on failed mitigations.
[0039] Platform compliance: entertainment/wellness-adjacent, no medical claims, privacy-minimizing.
[0040] == MVP vs Full ==
[0041] MVP: bed mode, manual controls, education, safety, local storage.
[0042] Full: walking mode, voice, operator personas, mesh, marketplace, field simulator.
