# Implementation TODOs (v3)

## MVP (Phase 1)
- [ ] App shell + navigation (Dashboard, Session, Settings, Education)
- [ ] Consent gates + emergency stop (always visible)
- [ ] Bed Mode session lifecycle (start → active → integrate → exit)
- [ ] Renderer preview (2D/3D placeholder) with safe intensity caps
- [ ] LocalVault storage (encrypted at rest where supported)
- [ ] EducationHub interactive orientation
- [ ] Audit log (local-only, deletable)

## Phase 2
- [ ] Walking mode mechanics (mobile-safe intensity constraints)
- [ ] VoiceCommandSystem (wake word, VAD, confirmations, privacy controls)
- [ ] SessionRecorder (opt-in, LocalVault)

## Phase 3
- [ ] Mesh sessions (roles, consent, leave instantly)
- [ ] Marketplace (policy scanning, reporting, takedown workflow)

## Phase 4
- [ ] Field Simulator (symbolic parameter mapping)
- [ ] Operator persona marketplace (tone-only, strict safety scanning)
